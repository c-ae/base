# CryptOpt Base Repository / Archive.

* [Jumpstart.md](./Jumpstart.md) contains instructions on how to get CryptOpt working and generate some assembly files. Read this if you'd like to see CryptOpt in action.

* [CryptOpt.md](./CryptOpt.md) contains (detailed) technical documentation for the optimizing / generation phase. Read this if you'd like to understand how the code-generation in CryptOpt internally works.

* The code for the equivalence checking can be found [here](./fiat-crypto/src/Assembly). Read this if you'd like to know how the code is parsed back into fiat-crypto and how the equivalence is checked.
